# Nexus

Nexus is a framework for the development of distributed applications (including, but not limited
to, massively multiplayer online games).

It is implemented in the Java language, though it is designed to be usable with JavaScript-based
clients via the Google Web Toolkit Java to JavaScript compiler.

It is currently functional for single server systems. The support for scaling a Nexus installation
to multiple servers is not yet complete.

## Building

At the top-level run:

    mvn install

to build the various jar files and install them into your local Maven repository.
